This project extends the previous module 11 work. In addition to creating a ReSTful service, I used JSON objects to transfer
data back and forth from the client to the server and the server back to the client. I implemented this using the Jackson library.
This would allow a user to enter their information in the same form as previous modules and return their price and/or errors
on the same webpage.

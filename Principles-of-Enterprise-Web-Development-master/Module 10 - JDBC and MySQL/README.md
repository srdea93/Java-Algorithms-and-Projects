In this project I implemented JDBC to connect my webservice to a MySQL database. This project is to allow an employee
of a hiking company to view all booked hikes within the MySQL database after a certain input date. This data
is queried to the MySQL database using JDBC and formatted into a table to be visualized on a webpage by the employee.

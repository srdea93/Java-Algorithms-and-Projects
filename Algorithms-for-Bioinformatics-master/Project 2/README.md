This project is designed to take in integer data and hash it using various hashing methods ranging from modulo division to radix-based addition. It implements a rudimentary
hash table with differing collision handling schemes (linear and quadratic probing as well as open-addressing chaining) as well as implementation of 
collision handling on differing bucket sizes.
